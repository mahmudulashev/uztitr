Morning News</b> is an American early morning television news program for CBS News that is broadcast on CBS. The program features late-breaking news stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. Since 2013, it has been anchored by Anne Marie Green, who concurrently anchored the CBS late-night news program <i>Up to the Minute</i> until its cancellation in September 2015. The program is broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time (airing in the early timeslot to accommodate CBS stations that start their local morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m.), and is transmitted in a continuous half-hour tape delayed loop until 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, when <i>CBS This Morning</i> begins in the Pacific Time Zone. The program usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most CBS stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the CBS station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of <i>This Morning</i>. The show is updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, while stations throughout the network will join <i>CBS This Morning</i> in all time zones past that time at their local discretion or network orders for live coverage.</p>","updated":1720257734,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/14275"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1298111","name":"Episode 194"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/851757"},"show":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/14275","name":"CBS Morning News"}}},{"id":851780,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/851780/squawk-box-2016-07-13-2016-07-13","name":"2016-07-13","season":2016,"number":138,"type":"regular","airdate":"2016-07-13","airtime":"06:00","airstamp":"2016-07-13T10:00:00+00:00","runtime":180,"rating":{"average":null},"image":null,"summary":"","show":{"id":10562,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/10562/squawk-box","name":"Squawk Box","type":"News","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":180,"averageRuntime":154,"premiered":"1995-10-18","ended":null,"officialSite":"http://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/","schedule":{"time":"06:00","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":48,"network":{"id":93,"name":"CNBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":null},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":null,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/35/89114.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/35/89114.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Squawk Box</b> is a business news television program that airs at breakfast time on the CNBC network.

Copeland has been strongly identified with preaching a prosperity and abundance message, commonly referred to as the prosperity gospel over the last 45 years. His Tarrant County, Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries (KCM) advocates daily application of the \"Word of God\", meaning the Bible. KCM is a teaching ministry that specializes in biblical teaching that focuses on faith, love, healing, prosperity and restoration through diverse media, such as television, books, CD and DVD. KCM's motto is Jesus is Lord based upon Romans 10:9.</p><p>Historically, Copeland's ministry held a number of conventions across the United States which lasted anywhere from three to six days. The number of longer set conventions has waned in recent years, although KCM still holds an annual Believer's Convention in his hometown of Fort Worth during the week of July 4. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, along with ministry friends including some family members, also preach at other conventions and conferences throughout the world. These events stream live on Copeland's website, kcm.org, as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as God TV and the Daystar Television Network. Portions of recorded conferences are shown Sundays.

Its main focus is investment and speculation, particularly in publicly traded stocks. In a notable departure from the CNBC programming style prior to its arrival, <i>Mad Money</i> presents itself in an entertainment-style format rather than a news broadcasting one. Cramer defines \"mad money\" as the money one \"can use to invest in stocks ... not retirement money, which you want in 401K or an IRA, a savings account, bonds, or the most conservative of dividend-paying stocks.\" <i>Mad Money</i> replaced Dylan Ratigan's <i>Bullseye</i> for the 6 p.m. Eastern Time slot. On January 8, 2007, CNBC began airing reruns of the show at 11 p.m. Eastern Time, on Monday through Friday, and at 4 a.m. Eastern Time, on Saturdays.</p><p>In March 2012, the program became a part of what was formerly branded as <i>NBC All Night</i> in the nominal 3:07 a.m. ET/2:07 a.m. timeslot on weeknights, replacing week-delayed repeats of NBC's late night talk shows. In that form, only the video for the program was presented on a 16:9 screen with gray branded windowboxing andpillarboxing, with all enhanced business information, including the CNBC Ticker, removed. Because of the scheduling of local station's 4 a.m. or 4:30 a.m. newscasts to air<i>Early Today</i> depending on how a station schedules its overnight programming (even if it airs at the regular time in the Eastern and Pacific time zones for instance, seven minutes would have to be cut-off to fit in <i>Early Today</i> and a local newscast starting at 4:30 a.m.), it is subject to local pre-emption, including by NBC O&amp;O's.</p><p>On August 4, 2014, <i>Mad Money</i> was first broadcast in full 1080i HD, resulting in the removal of the sidebar that was seen on all of CNBC's other trading-day programming, until the sidebar itself was permanently removed altogether on October 13, 2014. The NBC presentation displays the native widescreen HD picture, albeit with the CNBC Ticker space still filled in with gray windowboxing.</p>","updated":1728240670,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/9076"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/3022550","name":"Episode 220"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/851395"},"show":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/9076","name":"Mad Money"}}},{"id":851456,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/851456/special-report-2016-07-13-episode-139","name":"Episode 139","season":2016,"number":139,"type":"regular","airdate":"2016-07-13","airtime":"18:00","airstamp":"2016-07-13T22:00:00+00:00","runtime":60,"rating":{"average":null},"image":null,"summary":"","show":{"id":9069,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9069/special-report","name":"Special Report","type":"News","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"averageRuntime":61,"premiered":"1998-01-26","ended":null,"officialSite":"https://www.foxnews.com/shows/special-report","schedule":{"time":"18:00","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":6.4},"weight":80,"network":{"id":185,"name":"Fox News Channel","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":"https://www.foxnews.com/"},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":null,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/518/1295155.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/518/1295155.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Special Report with Bret Baier</b> (formerly <i>Special Report with Brit Hume</i>) is an American television news and political commentary program appearing on Fox News Channel, currently hosted by Bret Baier.

This show explores the hypocrisy of reality TV by centering around two sisters (Erin and Sara Foster) who say they would never do a reality show, but are being filmed by a camera crew.</p><p>Over the course of the season, we'll follow Erin and Sara as they navigate the treacherous LA waters of building a career, dating, and simultaneously trying to prove that they're \"normal\". Each episode of Barely Famous will skewer Hollywood stereotypes and comment on the world of celebrity through the eyes of two D-Listers, desperately trying to insist they don't care about \"Lists\" while also trying to get on the A-List. By breaking the 4th wall and occasionally telling both the crew and network to cut, no reality convention is too sacred, and our girls point out the absurdity of the medium itself.</p><p>Although Erin and Sara's quest for success is riddled with hiccups, their motives remain pure. Erin, an aspiring screenwriter, but somewhat of an acquired taste, has yet to land her big break. Her connections score her some great meetings but drinking a famous producer's iced tea during one landed her no seat in his writer's room. Her ongoing search for love has also proven tricky. Spanning the spectrum of dating an average looking guy she met at the Mac Store, to answering booty calls from an elusive actor, Erin has yet to land Mr. Right. She struggles with desperately wanting a normal marriage with 2.5 kids while being surrounded by Hollywood's Elite.</p><p>Being Barely Famous has different pitfalls for Sara, however. Born to be in front of the camera, she is determined to make a big comeback. Weaseling her way into the spotlight is no easy feat and denying that she ever gave birth is even harder for Sara. To stay relevant and score free stuff, Sara spends a lot of her time reminding normal people of her lengthy list of credits. Bachelor Party 2, D.E.B.S, and The New 90210, have inflated Sara's sense of self but haven't done much for her IMDB Star Meter – or getting her daughter into LA's most Elite Preschool either.</p><p>From awkward encounters with celebrities and scrambling to book the next big gig, to the day-to-day details of accidentally breaking up a handicapped man's marriage, this duo fumbles their way through life in a surprisingly endearing way. They may not have a spot on the A-List or even a publicist who knows their names, but at least they have each other. And who knows, with all of their charisma and wit caught on camera, they're sure to end up Famous, even if it's just Barely.</p>","updated":1731737197,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3406"},"previousepisode":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/866701","name":"Breaking Blonde"}}},"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/850621"},"show":{"href":"https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3406","name":"Barely Famous"}}},{"id":851641,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/851641/cnn-tonight-2016-07-13-episode-141","name":"Episode 141","season":2016,"number":141,"type":"regular","airdate":"2016-07-13","airtime":"22:00","airstamp":"2016-07-14T02:00:00+00:00","runtime":120,"rating":{"average":null},"image":null,"summary":"","show":{"id":9288,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9288/cnn-tonight","name":"CNN Tonight","type":"News","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Ended","runtime":120,"averageRuntime":107,"premiered":"2014-04-15","ended":"2021-05-14","officialSite":"http://www.cnn.com/shows/cnn-tonight","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"]},"rating":{"average":2.4},"weight":80,"network":{"id":40,"name":"CNN","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"},"officialSite":null},"webChannel":null,"dvdCountry":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":null,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/498/1245263.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/498/1245263.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>CNN Tonight</b> is the title of several news programs that were broadcast by U.S. cable network CNN.

Stephen Colbert took over as host, executive producer, and writer of The Late Show on Sept. 8, 2015. </p><p>Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and lest known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Before joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed The Colbert Report, which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one-third of the time.
